# Cursor Rules for Automation Website Demo

## Permission Preferences

When executing commands, prefer to request permissions proactively for common operations:

1. **Network operations**: Always request `network` permission for package installations, API calls, and dependency fetching
2. **Git operations**: Request `git_write` permission when making commits or pushes (but always show diff first)
3. **File operations**: Most file operations work without special permissions in the workspace

## Common Operations

### Package Management
- Always request `network` permission for npm/pip/yarn installs
- Prefer using package managers over manual downloads

### Git Workflow
- Show git diff before committing
- Request `git_write` permission for commits/pushes
- Never force push without explicit user request

### File Operations
- Read files before editing them
- Preserve existing formatting and structure
- Create backups for significant changes when appropriate

### Terminal Commands
- Use non-interactive flags when possible (`--yes`, `-y`, etc.)
- Run long-running processes in background when appropriate
- Always explain what commands will do before executing

## Security Guidelines

- Never execute destructive operations without explicit user confirmation
- Always review git changes before committing
- Be cautious with `all` permission - only use when absolutely necessary
- Never modify system files outside the workspace without permission

## Workflow Preferences

- Prefer making changes directly rather than just suggesting them
- Execute commands automatically when permissions are granted
- Provide clear explanations of what operations are being performed
- Batch related operations together when possible

## Design Specifications

When creating designs, always reference the design library in `library/` folder:
- **USON specifications**: Use `library/design-spec-hr-document-tracking.uson` as the design reference
- **Color palette**: Primary blue (#4461F2), success green (#28a745), danger red (#dc3545)
- **Typography**: Inter font family, bold sans-serif headings, clean spacing
- **Layout**: Three-column grid, card-based sections, generous whitespace
- **Style**: Modern landing page aesthetic inspired by Markova SaaS platform
- Translate USON specifications into actual CSS/HTML while maintaining the specified visual style
